# Example DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) XML project

DITA is a XML-based technical documentation markup language. The specification of DITA is vast and covers all aspects of technical documentation but may be considered excessive to document software. Therefore Helpinator supports a subset of features that match Helpinator own content types. It does not produce any content by itself, you have to employ XSLT transformations for it, like DITA-OT.

This repository contains DITA project exported from Helpinator project using "Export DITA" command. You can use it for educational purposes.
